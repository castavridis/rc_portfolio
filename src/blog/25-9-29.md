Quickly reviewed existing MediaPipe tools. For the first projet, gesture 
to phonics, it seems like the Hand Landmark tool will work for input. I was
surprised at how low-latency the web implementation is. A cursory glance through
the MediaPipe models (of which there are surprisingly many) it seems like 
I will have to find another approach to recognizing handwriting.

A search seems to point me toward OCR with the purpose of converting handwriting
to characters: https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/handwriting. Jon recommended
Shapecatcher to me.

Jon's ideas:
- Consider shapecatcher
- Consider qhanzi.com
- Consider kanji.sljfaq.org
- Have a second camera on the back to detect touches.
- Or use a Z index to identify when her finger is down.
